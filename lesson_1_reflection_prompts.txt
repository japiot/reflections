How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    bug might be a typo

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can ind when the mistake was made and in which version it occured for the first time

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    we can double chceck the file before commiting 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In google docs files are usually independent. When programming (Using Git) we tend to make a function in one file and just call it in another file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    It allows for quick comparison between two files and makes finding lines that were changed much easier

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Even when something goes wrong I can still go back to earlier versions and find the bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Keeping track of my versions when programming
