When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using remote repository is good when working remotely with other people 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When working on a project changes that I make may not allways be the ones that I want to be saved (pulled) automatically.
    Not staying up-to-date with my repository gives me ability to always have an older version on GitHub in case I want to go back 
    to the older version.
