When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using remote repository is good when working remotely with other people 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When working on a project changes that I make may not allways be the ones that I want to be saved (pulled) automatically.
    Not staying up-to-date with my repository gives me ability to always have an older version on GitHub in case I want to go back 
    to the older version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches exist in one commit, either locally or on GiHub. Forks are used to copy one's reposiitory into your own so you can work on 
    and without modifyiyng the original repository. Clones gives you ability to work on a repository locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It gives you ability to work on a project while offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Google docs is a kind of alternative

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
